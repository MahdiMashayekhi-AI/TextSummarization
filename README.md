# Text Summarization
Text Summarization is the process of creating a summary of a certain document which contains the most important information of the original, the purpose of which is to obtain a summary of the main points of the document. In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on text summarization with Python.üòä

There is a huge amount of data appearing digitally, so it is necessary to develop a unique procedure to immediately summarize long texts while keeping the main idea. Text summarization also makes it possible to shorten the reading time, speed up information searches and obtain as much information as possible on a subject.

he main goal of using machine learning for text summarization is to reduce the reference text to a smaller version while keeping its knowledge alongside its meaning. Multiple text summary descriptions are provided, for example, explained the report as text generated from one or more documents that communicate relevant knowledge in the first text, and that is no longer than half of the main text and generally much more limited than this.üß†

I hope you now know what is Text Summarization and why we need to use machine learning for it. In the section below, I will take you through a Machine Learning project on Text Summarization with Python.‚ù§Ô∏è
